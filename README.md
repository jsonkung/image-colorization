# Image Colorization
Implementation of image colorization methods described in https://webee.technion.ac.il/people/anat.levin/papers/colorization-siggraph04.pdf and https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mueller/research/colorize/colorize-sig02.pdf as well as a combination of both.

Dependencies can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the colorization methods, use `main.py` where several tests are already provided.
